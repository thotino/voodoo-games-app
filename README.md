# Project Overview
This project is a simple game database and consists of 2 components.  

The first component is a VueJS UI that communicates with an API and renders data in a simple browser-based UI.

The second component is an Express-based API server that queries and delivers data from an SQLite data source, using the Sequelize ORM.

# Project Setup
You will need to have Node.js, NPM, and git installed locally.  You should not need anything else.

To get started, initialize a local git repo by going into the root of this project and running `git init`.  Then run `git add .` to add all of the relevant files.  Then `git commit` to complete the repo setup.  You will send us this repo as your final product.
  
Next, in a terminal, run `npm install` from the project root to initialize your dependencies.

Finally, to start the application, navigate to the project root in a terminal window and execute `npm start`

You should now be able to navigate to http://localhost:3000 and view the UI.

You should also be able to communicate with the API at http://localhost:3000/api/games

If you get an error like this when trying to build the project: `ERROR: Please install sqlite3 package manually` you should run `npm rebuild` from the project root.

# Practical Assignments

#### FEATURE A: Add Search to Game Database
The main users of the Game Database have requested that we add a search feature that will allow them to search by name and/or by platform.  The front end team has already created UI for these features and all that remains is for the API to implement the expected interface.  The new UI can be seen at `/search.html`

The new UI sends 2 parameters via POST to a non-existent path on the API, `/api/games/search`

The parameters that are sent are `name` and `platform` and the expected behavior is to return results that match the platform and match or partially match the name string.  If no search has been specified, then the results should include everything (just like it does now).

Once the new API method is in place, we can move `search.html` to `index.html` and remove `search.html` from the repo.

#### FEATURE B: Populate your database with the top 100 apps
Add a populate button that calls a new route `/api/games/populate`. This route should populate your database with the top 100 games in the App Store and Google Play Store.
To do this, our data team have put in place 2 files at your disposal in an S3 bucket in JSON format:
